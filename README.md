# Recursive_ls

This little tool will recursivly ls -al the content in giving directory.

Simply moving the compiled lsr program into your path folder(usually '/bin/') 
will make this program runs globally: `sudo mv ./lsr /bin/`

This program runs as `lsr *path*` which *path* is optional. When *path* is provided,
lsr will output the current result of current directory.
